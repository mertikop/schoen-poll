# Schoen Poll Overview

Schoen Poll is a static, Firebase-backed live polling system for lectures or presentations. Participants use a clicker page, an admin controls the poll from a remote page, and a separate results page renders live vote bubbles for projection, OBS, or embedding in a slide deck.

## Main Pages

- `index.html`: Participant clicker. Users sign in anonymously, listen to `state/live`, and submit or remove one answer per question.
- `clicker.html`: Alias that redirects to `index.html`.
- `admin.html`: Admin remote. Google-authenticated admins launch questions, close or reopen voting, reveal or hide results, show the QR code, simulate votes, and adjust result bubble size. It listens to `state/live`, `state/display`, and `questions/{questionId}/answers`.
- `remote.html`: Alias that redirects to `admin.html`.
- `results.html`: Projector/overlay page. It loads D3, `schoen-poll.js`, and `schoen-poll.css` to render live results. It listens to `state/live`, `state/display`, and `questions/{questionId}/answers`.
- `history.html`: Admin-only history page. It reads past questions, computes or reuses cached tallies, renders stacked result bars, and can delete all questions from a given day. It reads `state/live`, `questions`, and each relevant `questions/{questionId}/answers` subcollection, but does not use live listeners.

## Shared Files

- `config.js`: Firebase config, clicker URL used for the QR code, result colors, and preset answer-option buttons.
- `adminauth.js`: Shared Google admin authentication helper. It checks admin status by attempting to read the admin-only `state/display` document.
- `schoen-poll.js`: Results overlay logic. It listens to Firestore state and answers, then renders a D3 force simulation of answer bubbles.
- `schoen-poll.css`: Styling for the results overlay, labels, QR modal, and unobtrusive login button.
- `README.md`: Setup and Firebase rules documentation.

## Firestore Shape

- `state/live`
  - `active_question_id`: id of the current question document.
  - `status`: usually `open`, `closed`, or `complete`.
  - `options`: array of answer labels for the current question.
  - `colorClickers`: optional admin-controlled boolean. When true, participant clickers color their page background according to the selected answer.
- `state/display`
  - `reveal`: whether the results overlay is visible.
  - `showQR`: whether the QR code is visible.
  - `bubbleSize`: optional multiplier for result bubbles.
- `questions/{questionId}`
  - `timestamp`: creation timestamp.
  - `options`: answer labels for that question.
  - `finalTallies`: cached result object, when available.
  - `totalVotes`: cached total vote count, when available.
- `questions/{questionId}/answers/{userId}`
  - `choice`: selected answer label.
  - `timestamp`: server timestamp.

## Runtime Flow

1. The admin opens `admin.html` and signs in with Google.
2. `adminauth.js` verifies admin access by reading `state/display`.
3. The admin launches a question from preset options or custom comma-separated options.
4. `admin.html` creates a document in `questions`, then writes the active question to `state/live`.
5. Participants open `index.html`, sign in anonymously, listen to `state/live`, and see the active options.
6. Each participant writes their answer to `questions/{questionId}/answers/{userId}`.
7. `admin.html` listens to those answers for the live doughnut chart and vote count.
8. `results.html` listens to `state/live`, `state/display`, and answers. When `reveal` is true, it shows D3 bubbles grouped by option.
9. When the admin finishes a question, `state/live.status` becomes `complete` and `state/display.reveal` is reset to false.
10. `history.html` later reads questions and answers, caches final tallies where useful, and displays grouped history by day.

## Notes

- This is designed to be hosted as static files, for example through GitHub Pages.
- Firebase Authentication must allow Google sign-in for admins and anonymous sign-in for participants.
- Firestore rules are central to the design: public read access is only for `state/live`, participants can only read/write their own answer documents, and admin-only pages rely on admin access to protected documents.
- The same `colors` palette from `config.js` is used by the results bubbles, the admin chart, history bars, and optional colored clicker backgrounds.
- `results.html` is intentionally usable as an overlay source, including in OBS or embedded in presentation tooling.
